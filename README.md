# Healthcare Patient Segmentation – Business Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing patient visit behavior in a healthcare setting to improve operational efficiency and resource planning.

## Business Problem
Healthcare organizations lack visibility into patient visit patterns, leading to inefficient staffing and increased wait times.

## Objective
Segment patients using clustering techniques to identify utilization patterns and operational risks.

## My Role (Business Analyst)
- Defined business problem and success criteria
- Documented BRD and requirements
- Interpreted analytical results into business insights
- Provided operational recommendations

## Tools & Techniques
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- K-Means & DBSCAN clustering
- Data visualization
- Business requirements documentation

## Key Insights
- Identified high-frequency patient clusters
- Detected anomalous visit behaviors
- Highlighted operational planning opportunities

## Outcome
Provided data-driven insights to support healthcare operational decision-making.
