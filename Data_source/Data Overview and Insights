#	Data Source & Understanding

## Source of the Data

This project uses healthcare simulation data sourced from Emergency Room Simulation-Inspired Data available on OpenDataBay:

👉 Emergency Room Simulation-Inspired Data
🔗 https://www.opendatabay.com/data/healthcare/48a3cbc8-e1ab-4b9c-af06-dbf9b0ebadd6

The dataset is designed to model hospital emergency room visits with synthetic or de-identified records suitable for analytics and operational research. It does not contain personally identifiable information (PII) and may be used for analytical and educational purposes.

📂 Purpose of the Dataset

The dataset represents historical emergency room simulations and contains information useful for:

Analyzing patient flow patterns

Identifying utilization clusters

Supporting operational decision-making

Evaluating healthcare resource needs

In this project, the dataset is used to understand and segment patients based on visit behavior and usage patterns to support operational improvements.



##  🧠 What the Data Represents

Each record in the dataset correlates with a simulated patient visit history, capturing attributes related to:

The number and frequency of visits

Time between visits

Visit duration

Patient characteristics relevant to clustering

This structure allows us to apply techniques such as K-Means and DBSCAN clustering to find distinct patient behavior segments.



## Key Parameters in the Dataset

Below is a table outlining the major fields in the data and their business relevance:

Field Name		Description			Business Relevance
Patient_ID		Anonymized patient identifier	Tracks unique patients for grouping
Arrival_Time		Timestamp of patient arrival	Used to calculate visit frequency
Departure_Time		Timestamp of leaving ER		Allows computation of visit durations
Visit_Duration		Time spent in ER (derived)	Indicates operational load per visit
Total_Visits		Count of visits (derived)	Key metric for segmentation
Days_Between_Visits	Average days between visits	Indicator of visit behavior patterns
Priority_Level		Severity code/triage category	May differentiate patient urgency
Other_Attributes	Additional simulation variables	Used for deeper pattern analysis

Note: Some attributes are derived during preprocessing (e.g., Visit_Duration, Total_Visits, Days_Between_Visits) based on original dataset fields.



## Data Characteristics
Type

Structured tabular data

Format

CSV or equivalent tabular format (loaded into a DataFrame)

Granularity

Each row represents a single patient or visit entity, depending on preprocessing

Use Case in This Project

This project uses clustering on visit metrics to find:

Frequently returning patients

Normal utilization groups

Anomalous or outlier patterns

Subgroups that may indicate operational concerns



##🧹 Data Preparation Steps

To ensure high-quality analysis, the following preprocessing was performed:

Missing Value Handling: Removed or imputed blank fields

Derived Metrics: Calculated visit duration, total visits, days between visits

Feature Scaling: Standardized numerical values for clustering

Outlier Screening: Identified extreme values that could distort clusters

This preparation ensured the data was suitable for applying unsupervised learning techniques for segmentation.



## Why These Fields Matter

Each parameter contributes to understanding patient behavior differently:

Arrival and visit frequency: Identifies patients who use the ER frequently

Visit duration: Suggests complexity of care or system strain

Days between visits: Separates periodic vs sporadic utilization

Priority levels: Helps characterize patient urgency and potential resource needs

Together, these help identify:

High utilization cohorts

Routine or low-impact patients

Anomalous or unusual patterns

These insights can inform staffing, scheduling, and resource allocation — essential for healthcare operations.
